Notes:
1) I did this project on a very high level. Usually I do not hard code values.
2) I have written the steps directly in the step definition file. Usually we follow POM framework where
there is a file for each page.
==============================================================================
Observations:
1) The application under test was very raw and seems like it's under development.
2) It was not developed with having automation in mind and there were no proper id's for elements.
3) Also the application was not very stable. The filter of search was not working properly.
